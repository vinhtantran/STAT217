## Getting Started

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, 
                      message = F, 
                      warning = F, 
                      tidy = F, 
                      fig.align = "center", 
                      fig.width = 8, 
                      fig.height = 5, 
                      cache = F)
set.seed(42)
```


Once you have opened RStudio you can begin to use R.  In some ways, R is very similar to a calculator.  You can do basic addition in it by running commands in the console.

```{r addition}
3 + 4
```


## Testing Out R

1. Use R to add $615+247$ by typing `615 + 247` into the console then hitting Enter.

*** .hint
You can just copy and paste into the R console.

*** .explanation
1. <span class='answer'>`r 615+247`</span>

## Creating Variables

One of the nice things about R is that you can store information.  Here, assign the letter `x` to have a value of 3 by typing the following code into the console and hitting Enter.

```{r store-x}
x <- 3
```

The `<-` symbol is the assignment operator in R.  Now, any time I type `x` R will return 3.

```{r print-x}
x
```

I can now use `x` for addition

```{r add-x}
x + 4
```



## Making Your New Variable

Copy and paste the following code into the R console.  This will assign `y` to have the value of 1024.

```{r assign-y}
y <- 1024
```

If you want to check and make sure this worked, type in `y` in the R console then hit enter.  If the object was correctly assigned then R should return 1024.  Otherwise, an error message will be printed.



## Using Assigned Variables

Now that you have assigned `x` to be 3 and `y` to be 1024, let's use R to do some addition.

1. What is $3 + 1024 + 698$?  Copy and paste `x+y+698` into the R console and hit enter.


*** .hint
Make sure you have assigned `x` to have the value of 3 and `y` to have the value of 1024

*** .explanation
1. <span class='answer'>1725</span>

## An Error in R

Sometimes R doesn't understand what we are trying to tell it.  It will generate an error.  Copy and paste `x+Y+698` and hit enter.  A bright red error message should occur.  Why is this?

1. R hates me 
2. _R is case sensitive and I used a capital Y_
3. R can only execute commands once

*** .hint
Note that the "Y" has been capitalized


## R Scripts

Scripts are very useful in R because the allow us to save the commands that we've run.  To open up a script, click **File** -> **New File** -> **R Script**.  A new script should appear and your screen should look something like this.

<iframe src='img/new-r-script.png' width='700' height='400' frameborder='0'>
</iframe>

You can type a line of code into the R script, then hit Ctrl+Enter to run that line.  Try typing 3+4 into your new R script then running that.  It should look something like

<iframe src='img/r-script-line-of-code.png' width='700' height='600' frameborder='0'>
</iframe>


## Mock Jury Data

Here, we'll need to reproduce the plots from Wednesday in class.  To begin, we need to load the `heplots` package.  Make sure the `heplots` package is installed (see the last paragraph of page 12 in your book) then type `require(heplots)` into your R script on a new line and run that line of code.  This loads all the code and datasets associated with the `heplots` package.

```{r load-heplots}
require(heplots)
```

We need to do some work to set up the data.  You can just copy and paste this section into your script and run it.

```{r mock-jury}
data(MockJury)
MockJury <- subset(MockJury, Attr != "Beautiful", select = c(Attr, Crime, Years, Serious, independent, sincere))
rownames(MockJury) <- 1:nrow(MockJury)
```

The dataset is now named "MockJury."  You can now view it by running

```{r view-data, eval=FALSE}
MockJury
```


## Some R commands

Instead of viewing the entire dataset, you can just the first six rows using "head"

```{r head-data}
head(MockJury)
```

Try

```{r tail-data}
tail(MockJury)
```

 &radio
## The `tail` function

What does `tail(MockJury)` do?

1. Prints the first six rows of the dataset
2. Prints six randomly selected rows from the dataset
3. _Prints the last six rows of the dataset_
4. Summarizes the dataset

*** .hint
Look at the row numbers

 
## Selecting Variables

Each column in the dataset is named (these named columns are called variables).  You can tell R to only print the "Years" variable using the dollar sign.

```{r data-years}
MockJury$Years
```


## More R functions

We can easily compute numerical summaries of variables using R functions.  Here, we compute the mean and standard deviation of the Years variable.

```{r mean-sd}
mean(MockJury$Years)
sd(MockJury$Years)
```

The `summary` function is very useful in R.  For a quantitative variable, it will return the 5 number summary as well as the mean.

```{r summary}
summary(MockJury$Years)
```


## Plotting in R

We can use the `hist` and `boxplot` functions to make histograms and boxplots of the Years variable.

```{r plots}
hist(MockJury$Years)
boxplot(MockJury$Years)
```
