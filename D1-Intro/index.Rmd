# Getting Started with R Console

Once you have opened RStudio you can begin to use R.  R is an **interpreted language**, which means it answers your commands one by one in the console (the left half of the RStudio window). If you type
```{r addition, eval=F}
3 + 4
```
and press *Enter*, the console respond right away (you will not see `##` in the console, it is here to separate inputs and outputs)
```{r addition2, echo=F}
3 + 4
```

## TryIt!

Use R to add 615 to 247, then divided by 3, type `(615 + 247)/3` into the console then hitting Enter. Check your answer, is it
```{r addition3, echo=F}
(615 + 247)/3
```

# R Scripts

Instead of typing every commands in the console, and looking at your workflow "flows away", we can use a **script**. Scripts are very useful in R because they allow us to save the commands that we've run.  To open up a script, click *File* -> *New File* -> *R Script*. You should see that the console pane now moves down to reveal a new ***Source pane***.

</iframe>

You can type a line of code into the R script, then hit `Ctrl+Enter` in Windows or `Command+Enter` on Mac to run that line.  Try typing 3+4 into your new R script then running that, look at how that line is copied to Console and run. It should look something like

# Creating Variables

One of the nice things about R is that you can store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) into a **variable** in R. Later, you can use that variable to access to the information stored within it.

The following command assigns value `4` to a variable `my.var`

```{r store}
my.var <- 4
```

## TryIt: Creating a Variable

To help you try out the code, I embed the Source and Console panes into this page. Complete the code in the editor as instructed.

```{r ex="create_a", type="sample-code", tut=TRUE}
# Create a variable a, equal to 5
a <-

# Print out a
a
```

```{r ex="create_a", type="solution", tut=TRUE}
# Create a variable a, equal to 5
a <- 5

# Print out a
a
```

```{r ex="create_a", type="sct", tut=TRUE}
test_object("a")
test_output_contains("a", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to print `a`.")
success_msg("Great!")
```
> **Note**: Anything on a line that appears after `#` is considered a comment and will be ignored by the interpreter. Commenting in your code is a good programming practice to explain what you're doing to the reader, and to the future you also. 

## TryIt: Using Assigned Variables

The following template gives you the value of `a` is 5. Create another variable `b` with value 6, then add them together to find the total. Finally, create a new variable `c` taking the value of the above addition.

```{r ex="add_ab", type="sample-code", tut=TRUE}
# Create variables a and b
a <- 5


# Add these two variables together


# Create variable c as the sum of a and b


```

```{r ex="add_ab", type="solution", tut=TRUE}
# Create variables a and b
a <- 5
b <- 6

# Add these two variables together
a + b

# Create variable c as the sum of a and b
c <- a + b
```

```{r ex="add_ab", type="sct", tut=TRUE}
test_object("a", incorrect_msg = "Keep the line that assigns 5 to `a`.")
test_object("b", incorrect_msg = "Keep the line that assigns 6 to `b`.")
test_output_contains("a + b",
                     incorrect_msg = "Make sure to print out the result of adding `a` and `b` by typing `a + b`")
msg <- "Have you used `c <- a + b` to create the `c` variable?"
test_object("c", undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
success_msg("Nice one! The great advantage of doing calculations with variables is reusability. If you just change `a` to equal 12 instead of 5 and rerun the script, `c` will automatically update as well.")
```

## An Error in R
Sometimes R doesn't understand what we are trying to tell it.  It will generate an error.  Try running the following code.

```{r ex="error", type="pre-exercise-code", tut=TRUE}
a <- 5
b <- 6
c <- a + b
```

```{r ex="error", type="sample-code", tut=TRUE}
# Add two variables together
a + B
```

```{r ex="error", type="sct", tut=TRUE}
success_msg("Great. Now answer the question below.")
```


```{r error, echo=FALSE}
x <- "A bright red error message should occur.  Why is this?

1. R hates me 
2. _R is case sensitive and I used a capital B_
3. R can only execute commands once
"

hint <- "Note that the `B` has been capitalized"

quiz(x, hint)
```

# MockJury Data

*Let's return to RStudio.*

## Installing R Package
R is popular not only because it is open source (and free), but also because it is a *framework* where people can create their own functions and distribute them to others under the form of **packages**.

The data set called `MockJury` will be used as the example in Wednesday class. Let's try it out today. The data set is built within the `heplots` package. To begin, we need to install the package (we need to do it only once!). Look at the bottom right pane. There you can choose *Packages* tab, and click *Install*. Type `heplots` when prompted and click ``Install``. That easy!

To load `heplots` package, type `require(heplots)` into your R script on a new line and run that line of code.  This loads all the code and data sets associated with the `heplots` package.

```{r load-heplots}
require(heplots)
```

Let's learn a little bit about the data set `MockJury` by loading R help page on the data by typing
```{r help1, eval=FALSE}
help(MockJury)
```
or
```{r help2, eval=FALSE}
?MockJury
```

The bottom right pane now changes into *Help* tab with the information about the data set. Read the data description and answer the following question

```{r datadesc, echo=FALSE}
x <- "How many levels of attractiveness were recorded?

1. 1
2. 2
3. _3_
"

hint <- "Beautiful, average, and unattractive."

quiz(x, hint)
```

Let's load the data set to use.

```{r mock-jury}
data(MockJury)
```

The data set is now named `MockJury`.  You can now view it in the table form in Source pane by running (note the capital "V")

```{r view-data, eval=FALSE}
View(MockJury)
```


## Some R Commands on Data Set

Instead of viewing the entire data set, you can just show the first six rows using `head`. Change back into the script and run. The output is long and it may be cut into another block like below.
```{r head-data}
head(MockJury)
```

Try
```{r tail-data}
tail(MockJury)
```

```{r tail, echo=FALSE}
x <- "What does `tail(MockJury)` do?

1. Prints the first six rows of the dataset
2. Prints six randomly selected rows from the dataset
3. _Prints the last six rows of the dataset_
4. Summarizes the dataset
"

hint <- "Look at the row numbers."

quiz(x, hint)
```
 
## Selecting Variables

Each column in the data set is named (these named columns are called variables).  You can tell R to only print the "Years" variable using the dollar sign. The number in bracket gives you the position of the next value within a variable.

```{r data-years}
MockJury$Years
```


## More R functions

We can easily compute numerical summaries of variables using R functions.  Here, we compute the mean and standard deviation of the Years variable.

```{r mean-sd}
mean(MockJury$Years)
sd(MockJury$Years)
```

The `summary` function is very useful in R.  For a quantitative variable, it will return the 5 number summary as well as the mean.

```{r summary}
summary(MockJury$Years)
```


## Plotting in R

We can use the `hist` and `boxplot` functions to make histograms and boxplots of the Years variable. The result will show in the bottom right pane, *Plots* tab.

```{r plots}
hist(MockJury$Years)
boxplot(MockJury$Years)
```
