## Installing R

* Visit the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN)
* In the Download and Install R section, you can click on the link that corresponds to your system (Linux, Mac, or Windows).

### On Windows
* Click on **base**.
* Click on **Download R 3.5.0 for Windows** to download the executable file then open that file to start the installation.
* The installation should be straightforward. You can choose the displayed language, installation location on your disk, and the components. Leaving them at default will work for most of you. Uncheck the "Create a desktop icon" at the last step so you will be less confusing about which app to run later.
* Click **Finish** to end the installation of R.

### On Mac OS X
* Scroll down a little bit, you will see some download links designed for different version of your OS. If you have Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher, choose **R-3.5.0.pkg**. If your OS version is older than that, there is a link of an older version of R right below it.
* Once it is downloaded, double-click on the installer. You may take all of the defaults.

### On Linux Systems
* After clicking **Download R for Linux**, you will be shown different folders for different Linux distros. Select your distro, and proceed as directed.

## Installing RStudio
You will not use R directly in this course. Its UI is very basic and not beautiful. Instead, you will use RStudio, an enhanced interface that will make interacting with R less frustrating.

* Go to [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/). Scroll to the comparison table between different versions, we will use the RStudio Desktop Open Source License FREE. Click on the DOWNLOAD button for that version and choose the appropriate **Installers** for your operating system (Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux).
* Once it is downloaded, run the RStudio installer and take all of the defaults: In Windows, double-click on the RStudio installer to start the installation; in Mac OS X, double-click on the downloaded RStudio disk-image file, and drag the *RStudio* icon to the *Applications* folder.
*  How to Run RStudio

```{r, out.width="50px", echo=F, warning=F, message=F, fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio_icon.png")
```

  - In Windows system, click on Start icon and type in `rstudio` in the search box. Right-click and choose ``Pin to taskbar''. From now on you can open RStudio from the bottom bar on your screen. Also, minimize all windows and find a R icon on your desktop. We don't use this R. Delete it.
* To configure RStudio to your taste, select *Tools > Global Options* (Windows) or *RStudio > Preferences* (Mac OS X) from the RStudio menus. In particular, I suggest that on the *General* options screen you **deselect** *Restore .RData into workspace at startup*, and set *Save workspace to .RData on exit* to **Never**. 

## Using R on Campus Computers
R and RStudio are available on the computers in the Reid and Roberts computer labs. If you do not wish to
download R on your personal computer you may use those labs.
